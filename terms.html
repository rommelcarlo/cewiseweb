                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Welcome to CE Review Tracker!</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms of Use (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you and
                    WiseReview
                    (“we,” “us,” or “our”) and govern your access to and use of the CE Review Tracker mobile application (the
                    “App”). By
                    downloading, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
                    to be bound
                    by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms in their entirety, you are not authorized to
                    access or use
                    the App, and you must immediately discontinue any such use.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Eligibility</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Use of the App is limited to individuals who are at least thirteen (13) years of age. By
                    accessing
                    or using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet this minimum age requirement. If you are
                    under the age
                    of majority as defined by the laws of your jurisdiction, you may only use the App with the consent
                    and
                    supervision of a parent or legal guardian. By permitting a minor to use the App, the parent or legal
                    guardian
                    assumes full responsibility for the minor’s use, including compliance with these Terms of Use.</p>                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> To access certain features of the App, you must create a user
                        account
                        using a valid email address or third-party authentication providers such as Google or Apple. You
                        agree to
                        provide truthful, complete, and current information and to update it as necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
                        your login
                        credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any
                        unauthorized
                        use or security breach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single-Session Policy:</strong> For security purposes and to protect the integrity of our services, 
                        your account may only be actively logged in on one device at a time. Any attempt to log in from a second device 
                        will automatically terminate the previous session. This restriction is implemented to safeguard your account 
                        information, maintain data consistency, and prevent unauthorized access. We reserve the right to monitor login 
                        activities for suspicious patterns and may temporarily or permanently restrict access in cases of apparent 
                        account sharing or other violations of this policy. Users with legitimate needs for multi-device access should 
                        contact our support team for potential solutions.</li>
